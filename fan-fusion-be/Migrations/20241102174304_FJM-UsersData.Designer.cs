The hat grinned in his mind. ‘Perhaps this time, I’ll put you where you belong...’ As the feast continued, Harry’s heart raced. He knew that some choices were never meant to be undone, and now the Sorting Hat’s words haunted him. Maybe the real battle was never with Voldemort, but with himself.",

At the river, she saw him waiting, his violin case slung over his shoulder. ‘You came,’ he whispered, as if he hadn’t believed she would. Emma nodded, her breath visible in the chilly air.
